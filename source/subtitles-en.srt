00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,490
A T F. Chicago is responding to this active

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,919
shooter situation. The locals are now reporting that as

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,220
well. And I want to give you Mohr.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,919
You heard the local anchor there mentioned, uh,

5
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:15,199
suburban newspaper there for the suburbs of Chicago Is the

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,640
Daily Herald on it is the one who's on scene

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,649
and reporting that four Aurora police officers and multiple civilians

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,609
have been shot. We've been saying injured because that

9
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,219
was all the information we had. Now, this

10
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,700
is the first hard report from from the locals that

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,060
people have actually been shot. And among those four

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,509
Aurora police officers and multiple civilians shot with a with

13
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:48,789
a the suspect at large again. That's from the

14
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:53,570
Daily Herald, which bills itself Suburban Chicago's information source

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,950
. And I'll give you the rest that they have

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,020
reading through now from The Daily Herald. Four areas

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,829
for Aurora, Illinois police officers, multiple civilians have

18
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,530
been wounded, and the suspect suspected shooter is still

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,299
at large in this industrial area near Prairie and Highlands

20
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,349
Avenue, according to preliminary reports from the scene.

21
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,120
There were unconfirmed reports earlier, which I won't get

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,870
into because they're unconfirmed, but I can tell you

23
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,349
multiple victims are now being airlifted. Toe advocate Good

24
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,409
Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove, which is nearby again

25
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,280
. This the reporting of the Daily Herald SWAT teams

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,489
from through throughout the suburbs are being called to the

27
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,629
scene. Police are urging anyone in this area to

28
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:37,489
shelter in place and nearby Holy Angels school, and

29
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,799
some businesses are on what you heard earlier as a

30
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,909
soft locked down. So what was a serious situation

31
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,739
has become much more dire now, with the reporting

32
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,269
now from the from the suburban newspaper that four Aurora

33
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:53,590
police officers and multiple civilians have been shot and the

34
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,079
suspect currently at large. Ah, Jonathan Hunt is

35
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,959
work. Our chief correspondent is working sources in the

36
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,069
background here for some updates. Jonathan, what are

37
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:05,609
you learning, Shep? I think it's important to

38
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,750
note here that this is clearly a very active scene

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,449
. Still, obviously, the school district is a

40
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,180
major concern here. The West Aurora School District one

41
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,560
to nine has already posted a message to all parents

42
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,189
saying that every single district student is being held in

43
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:27,129
place now. Ah, locked down at all schools

44
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,560
. And the major concern, of course, is

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,240
that there is no indication what so ever at this

46
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,830
point that the police know exactly where this shooter is

47
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,280
that we certainly have no reports of anybody taken into

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,180
custody at this point on, I think, is

49
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,990
you look at these aerial pictures ship Shep around the

50
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,169
Henry Pratt Building in Aurora. It's interesting to note

51
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:53,370
, and I have not seen. I'm not sure

52
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,800
if you have, but I have not seen many
